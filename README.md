# Hotel bookings

## Business tasks
* Identify the group of guests who typically make early bookings
* Identify the market segments that generate the largest number of bookings, and where these bookings are made
## Dataset
* Dataset can be found in files
## Documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data
* Report of the analysis can be found [here](https://ngctramnl.github.io/Hotel-bookings/)
## Conclusions
* Online channel has the most number of bookings
* The group of guests who typically make early bookings do not have children
* The online segment generates the largest number of bookings, and these bookings are made for city hotels
* The plot reveals that bookings with children tend to have a shorter lead time, and bookings with 3 children have a significantly shorter lead time (<200 days). So, promotions targeting families can be made closer to the valid booking dates
