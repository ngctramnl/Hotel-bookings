# Hotel bookings

## Business tasks
* Describe the group of guests who typically make early bookings
* Identify the market segments that generate the largest number of bookings, and where these bookings are made
* Identify the specific timing for the promotion targeted at the fastest-growing segment
## Dataset
* Dataset can be found in files
* Lead Time is the period of time (most typically measured in calendar days) between when a guest makes the reservation and the actual check-in/arrival date
## Documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data
* Code and report of the analysis can be found [here](https://ngctramnl.github.io/Hotel-bookings/)
## Conclusions
* Online channel has the most number of bookings
* The group of guests who typically make early bookings do not have children
* The online segment generates the largest number of bookings, and these bookings are made for city hotels
* The plot reveals that bookings with children tend to have a shorter lead time, and bookings with 3 children have a significantly shorter lead time (<200 days). So, promotions targeting families can be made closer to the valid booking dates
