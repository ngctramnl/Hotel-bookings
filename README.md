# Hotel bookings

## Business tasks
* Identify the group of guests who typically make early bookings
* Identify the market segments that generate the largest number of bookings, and where these bookings are made

## Conclusions
* The plot reveals that bookings with children tend to have a shorter lead time, and bookings with 3 children have a significantly shorter lead time (<200 days)
* So, promotions targeting families can be made closer to the valid booking dates
