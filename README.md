# Hotel bookings

## Business tasks
* Describe the group of guests who typically make early bookings
* Identify the market segments that generate the largest number of bookings, and where these bookings are made
* Identify the specific timing for the promotion targeted at the fastest-growing segment
## Dataset
* Dataset can be found in files
* Lead Time is the period of time (most typically measured in calendar days) between when a guest makes the reservation and the actual check-in/arrival date
## Documentation of cleaning or manipulation of data
* The codes and report of the analysis can be found [here](https://ngctramnl.github.io/Hotel-bookings/)
## Conclusions
* The majority of reservations are made through an online channel, and they are made for hotels in cities.
* The group of visitors that usually reserve early doesn't have any kids.
* The plot indicates that reservations including children often have a shorter lead time, while reservations involving three children have an even shorter lead time (less than 200 days). So, promotions targeting families can be made closer to the valid booking dates.
